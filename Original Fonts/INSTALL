            Wen Quan Yi Bitmap Song CJK Fonts

                  Installation Guide

----------------------------------------------------------

The WenQuanYi Bitmap Song font (medium and bold weight) was
packaged into three equivalent formats: BDF (Bitmap Distribution 
Format), PCF (Portable Compiled Format) and TTF(True-type). 
All formats are supported by most modern X-window systems 
(TTF format requires FreeType 2.x or later). You can choose 
any of them based on your preference.


== Quick Summary ==

We highly suggest you downloading our DEB (for debian-based 
systems) or RPM (for Redhat-based systems) installation 
packages. One-command-installation can be achieved by
	dpkg -i  wqy-bitmapfont-*.deb
for deb package, or 
	rpm -ivh wqy-bitmapfont-*.rpm
For some users, the installed font can not be selected 
from font list, you may verify and make sure that a file
named "85-wqy-bitmapsong.conf" is copied to /etc/fonts/conf.d
directory.


== PCF/BDF Package Installation   ==

1. download

You can find the installation package from
our sourceforge download site at

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128192&package_id=156288

choose the latest release and select your preferred 
font format, save the installation file to a temporary 
directory, for example /tmp.

2. decompression

The package is usually a gz-ed tarball, to extract the files

  tar zxvf wqy-bitmapfont*.tar.gz

or 

  gunzip wqy-bitmapfont*.tar.gz
  tar xvf wqy-bitmapfont*.tar


3. move directory (optional)

You can find all extracted file under a subdirectory 
called "wqy-bitmapfont". You might want to move this 
directory to the location where you want
to install the font, a good place is

/usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/wqy-bitmapfont

To move the directory, you need to use "su" or "sudo" to obtain
root privileges. (If you don't have root privileges, please
refer to Section 6)

4. font path setup

Now you need to tell X-window where to find the installed font. 
There are two major font management mechanisms: X-core font
and fontconfig. We will discuss the installation for 
X-core font first.

Assuming you have installed the font to 
/usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/wqy-bitmapfont/

execute the follow commands

   su
   cd /usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/wqy-bitmapfont/
   rm fonts.dir fonts.scale fc-cache.*
   mkfontdir .
   cp fonts.dir fonts.scale
   xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/wqy-bitmapfont/

the last command adds the font path to the font path
list of current X-window session. To permanently add this path, 
you need to add 

  FontPath     "/usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/wqy-bitmapfont/" 

to /etc/X11/xorg.conf, under any line starting with "FontPath",
for example:

  FontPath     "unix/:7100"

if your system does not have xorg.conf, you are probabily 
running XFree86, then you should do the same thing for
/etc/X11/XF86Config-4

If you see "unix/:7100" in your xorg.conf, your X window 
is using "xfs". Typing the path to the font in /etc/X11/fs/config
under the line "catalogue =/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/," 
can do the same thing as you modify xorg.conf.

Now you have done with X Core font set up. Most recent 
versions of Linux X programs support Xft/fontconfig, which 
is a set of font search/selection rules. To make fontconfig 
aware of the newly installed WenQuanYi bitmap font, you need to 
insert the following line

  <dir>/usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/wqy-bitmapfont/</dir>

to /etc/fonts/fonts.conf  or ~/.fonts.conf, however, if you
installed the font into a subdirectory under /usr/share/fonts/, 
this is not required.

we provided a fontconfig file specifically optimized for wqy bitmap fonts,
named "85-wqy-bitmapsong.conf". To activate the optimized settings, you 
need to install this file as well. If /etc/fonts/conf/ directory exists
in your system, please directly move this file to that directory. If it does
not exist, you need to add the following line to the
end of /etc/fonts/fonts.conf (before </fontconfig>)

  <include>/usr/share/fonts/wenquanyi/wqy-bitmapfont/85-wqy-bitmapsong.conf</include>

if you are using the latest fontconfig-2.4.x, you can also move this file
to ~/.fontconfig/ directory, it will also do the job.

After all of above steps, type "fc-cache -f -v" to update fontconfig, 
In most cases, you need to restart your X-window  in order to activate
all the settings.


5. test

To test if the font is successfully installed, the following 
command

   /usr/X11R6/bin/xlsfonts | grep 'wenquanyi'


would print something like followings (you may also see font names for gb2312/big5 etc)

   -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-bold-r-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso10646-1
   -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-bold-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-119-iso10646-1
   -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-bold-r-normal--13-130-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
   -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-bold-r-normal--15-150-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
   -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-bold-r-normal--16-160-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
   -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso10646-1
   -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-119-iso10646-1
   -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--13-130-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
   -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--15-150-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
   -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--16-160-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
   ....

for fontconfig, you need 

   fc-list | grep 'WenQuanYi'

you would expect to see the following two lines as output

   WenQuanYi Bitmap Song:style=Bold
   WenQuanYi Bitmap Song:style=Regular

With KDE or GNOME font selection tools, you should be able to see 
"WenQuanYi Bitmap Song" in the font name list.


6. installation as a normal user

If you do not have root privilege, for example, you are using 
public machines, to install this font is also very simple. 
If you are using KDE, find "Control Center" from the K-menu 
(or type kcontrol from console), choose "System Administration" 
and click on "Font Installer", right click on the middle panel, 
choose "add font", locate the extracted fonts (bdf/pcf) files.

If you are using Gnome environment, double click on "Computer",
type "fonts:/" on the address bar, and type enter. Open another
file browser and select the bdf/pcf.gz font files, drag or 
copy/paste to the fonts:/ folder.

If you do not have X-window started, you can also install the 
font by extracting the BDF/PCF files to ~/.fonts/ directory 
(if it does not exist, create one after making sure you have 
fontconfig installed).

You may also add the following line to ~/.fonts.conf to use
pre-set configurations

  <dir>/path/to/wqy-bitmapfonts/</dir>
  <include>/path/to/85-wqy-bitmapsong.conf</include>

7. Turn on Chinese language support on your system

To correctly display Chinese, your system should
support Chinese language. You need to install the related
packages (for example, sudo apt-get install kde-i18n-Chinese*)
Then put the following line

 LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.UTF-8

into ~/.i18n and reboot your system (this file may not exist, in 
that case, you need to create it first by "touch ~/.i18n".
you can also use other locales in the output of 
"ls -d /usr/lib/locale/zh_*"). To enable command line Chinese 
message, replace "LC_CTYPE" by "LC_ALL". If you want all menu displayed
with Chinese language, on KDE, goto "Control center", click on "Region and
Assistance", find "Country/Region and Language", choose "Chinese" from 
"Add language"; if you are using Gnome, you need to select "Preference"
and "Language", then add "Chinese". Restart your X or system
if necessary to enable this setting. If you can not select "Chinese" for
either desktop environments, you need to install the corresponding
language package first.


== TTF Package Installation   ==

To install TTF version of Wenquanyi bitmap font is a little bit tricky.
The font file is a special type of TTF, called SFNT (or sbit only) TTF.
This format is supported by FreeType 2.x or later. Unfortunately, 
ttfmkdir and fc-cache can not recognize this format. So, we packaged
hand-writen configuration files, fonts.dir/fonts.scale/fonts.cache-1,
in the release. 

The installation process is very similar to PCF/BDF version, you can
type ttmkfdir and fc-cache -fv, in that case, the hand-writen config
files will be overwriten. You can find a font.config.tar.gz in the 
installation file, you need to decompress this file and restore
the correct fonts.* files. In the future, anytime you submit 
fc-cache -fv, you need to repeat the above process.

== RPM Package Installation   ==

if your system support RPM, to use RPM package is the simplest.
you simply type

sudo rpm -Uvh wqy-bitmapfont*noarch.rpm

then after restarting your X-window, you should be able
to use this font.

== Other issues   ==

For some old applications, such as Emacs, XMMS, you may need to 
do some extra configurations, you can search our FAQ page for
more details
